Lattice ECP5 Transplant for SD2SNES
===================================

Based on https://github.com/mrehkopf/sd2snes

* Main changes are FPGA, RAM and power. The SNES interface and MCU are broadly the same as SD2SNES
* Prototype is populated with ECP5U-45F for easy development - 12F or 25F parts are available for same footprint. 
* MSU-1 DAC mods from https://github.com/DevLaTron/sd2snes
* USB-C (2.0) connector

WARNING: This is still a prototype - it has managed to run games, but more than likely has some 'hilarious in hindsight' mistakes that have yet to be found.
